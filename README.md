This project is for detecting the drone with YOLO11x
The model is trained using RTX4090ti. If you want to train the model you have use the same or more powerfull GPU.
\\
The dataset for training the model is: IP_Proj_2-Quadcopter and you can find it over here: https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=like:kitkk%2Fip-proj-2-quadcopter .
